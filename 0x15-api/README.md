* Bash scripting is a powerful tool for automating tasks in Unix-like operating systems, but there are certain use cases for which it may not be the best choice.
> * CPU- or memory-intensive tasks: Bash is not well-suited for computationally heavy tasks. For such tasks, it's better to use a more efficient programming language like Python, C, or Java.
> * Large-scale applications: If you are developing a complex, large-scale software application, Bash may not be the most maintainable choice. High-level programming languages offer better support for structuring and managing large codebases.
> * Platform independence: Bash scripts are typically written for Unix-like systems. If you need your code to be portable across different platforms, a language like Python or Java might be a better choice.
> * GUI applications: Bash is primarily a command-line scripting language and is not suitable for building graphical user interfaces. Use languages like Python, Java, or C++ for GUI applications.
* An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allows one software application to interact with and request services or data from another software component, service, or system.
* APIs define the methods and data structures that developers can use to communicate with the software or platform, enabling them to access its functionality and resources. APIs are crucial for building and integrating software systems, as they enable different programs to work together and share information.
* A REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a type of API architecture that uses HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. REST is based on a set of principles that include statelessness, client-server architecture, and the use of standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources. REST APIs are commonly used in web services and web applications to provide a structured and scalable way to access and manipulate data over the internet.
* Microservices is an architectural approach to software development where an application is decomposed into small, independent, and loosely coupled services. Each service focuses on a specific, well-defined business function and can be developed, deployed, and maintained separately.
* Microservices promote flexibility, scalability, and ease of maintenance. They often communicate with each other through APIs and can be developed using different technologies. This architecture is well-suited for cloud-based and distributed systems.
* CSV stands for Comma-Separated Values. It is a simple and widely used file format for storing tabular data in plain text. In a CSV file, data is organized as rows and columns, with each row representing a record and columns containing different attributes or values. Comma (or other delimiters like semicolons or tabs) are used to separate values within each row. CSV files are easy to create, read, and edit, and they are commonly used for data interchange between different software applications and for data storage.
* JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON data is represented as key-value pairs and is used for structuring data in a hierarchical format. JSON is widely used in web development, APIs, and configuration files, and it is supported by many programming languages.
* Package and module names in Python should be in lowercase, with no underscores, and should be concise and descriptive. They should follow the PEP 8 style guide, which recommends using short, lowercase names with words separated by underscores if necessary.
* Class names in Python should follow the CapWords or CamelCase convention. This means that the first letter of each word in the class name should be capitalized, and there should be no underscores between words. For example, "MyClass" is a Pythonic class name.
* Variable names in Python should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores. This is known as the snake_case convention. Descriptive variable names help improve code readability and maintainability.
* Function names in Python should also be lowercase, with words separated by underscores (snake_case). They should be descriptive and indicate the purpose of the function.
* Constants in Python should be named using uppercase letters with words separated by underscores (e.g., ALL_CAPS_CONSTANT). This convention helps distinguish constants from variables.
* The CapWords or CamelCase naming convention is significant in Python as it is used for naming classes. It makes the class names distinct and easy to recognize in code. It aligns with Python's PEP 8 style guide, which provides guidelines for writing clean and readable Python code. Following these conventions helps maintain consistency in codebases and makes it easier for developers to understand and work with Python code.
