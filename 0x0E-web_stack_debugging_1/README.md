* IP Address: An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network. It serves as an identifier for sending and receiving data on the network. There are IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
* Port: Ports are used to differentiate between different services or processes running on the same device. Ports are identified by numbers, and common examples include port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS.
* DNS (Domain Name System): DNS is a system that translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers can understand. It's essential for navigating the web.
* Firewall: A firewall is a security device or software that filters and monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. It helps protect a network from unauthorized access and threats.
* Firewall: A firewall is a security device or software that filters and monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. It helps protect a network from unauthorized access and threats.
* HTTP Status Codes: When debugging a web application, understanding HTTP status codes is crucial. For example, a 404 status code indicates that a requested resource was not found.
* Logs: Web servers and web applications often generate logs. These logs can provide valuable information for debugging. Common log files include access logs and error logs.
* Browser Developer Tools: Modern web browsers come with developer tools that allow you to inspect and debug web pages. You can use these tools to view network requests, inspect HTML/CSS, and debug JavaScript.
* Server Logs: Check the server's error logs (e.g., Nginx or Apache logs) to identify issues with the web server configuration or application.
* Firewall and Security: Ensure that your firewall settings are not blocking incoming or outgoing traffic on the required ports. Also, consider security best practices to protect against common web application vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
* Load Balancing: If your web application uses load balancing, make sure that it's configured correctly and distributing traffic evenly.
* Database Connectivity: If your web application relies on a database, check database connection settings and query execution to identify potential issues.
* Caching: Caching can improve web application performance, but it can also lead to stale data. Ensure your caching strategy aligns with your application's requirements.
* Monitoring and Profiling: Consider using monitoring tools to track server performance, resource usage, and application behavior. Profiling tools can help identify performance bottlenecks in your code.
* Error Handling: Implement proper error handling in your code and log detailed error messages to aid in debugging.
* Version Control: If you're working on a team, version control (e.g., Git) is essential. It allows you to track changes, collaborate, and roll back to previous versions if needed.
