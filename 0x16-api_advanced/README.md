# API advanced
* How to read API documentation to find the endpoints youâ€™re looking for:
> * API documentation typically provides details about available endpoints, their purposes, and how to use them. You should look for an "endpoints" or "API reference" section in the documentation.
> * Read the descriptions and examples provided for each endpoint to understand their functionality.
> * Pay attention to the HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) used with each endpoint, required request parameters, and possible response data.
* How to use an API with pagination:
> * APIs that return large sets of data often use pagination to limit the number of results per request.
> * Look for pagination-related parameters in the API documentation, such as "page" and "per_page."
> * To paginate through results, make multiple requests, incrementing the "page" parameter to retrieve subsequent pages of data.
* How to parse JSON results from an API:
> * Most modern APIs return data in JSON format, which can be easily parsed in many programming languages.
> * Use JSON parsing libraries or functions in your programming language to decode the JSON response into native data structures, like dictionaries or objects.
* How to make a recursive API call:
> * Sorting a dictionary by its values is typically language-specific, as dictionaries in different programming languages have different properties.
> * In Python, you can use the sorted() function with a custom key to sort a dictionary by its values.
> * In other languages, you may need to convert the dictionary into a list of key-value pairs, sort that list, and then reconstruct a new dictionary from the sorted pairs.
