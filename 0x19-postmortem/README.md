# Issue Summary:
* Duration of Outage: 45 minutes, from 2:00 PM to 2:45 PM PST on September 15, 2023
* Impact: Our web application experienced downtime for 45 minutes, affecting all users.
* Root Cause: A misconfiguration in the database connection settings led to a
              failure in establishing connections, causing the web application to be unresponsive.

# Timeline:
* 2:00 PM PST: Monitoring alert triggers, indicating the web application is down.
* 2:01 PM PST: Engineers initiate investigation into the issue.
* 2:15 PM PST: Engineers identify the misconfiguration in the database connection settings.
* 2:30 PM PST: Engineers implement a temporary workaround to restore web application functionality.
* 2:45 PM PST: Permanent fix deployed, and the web application is fully operational.

# Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths:
* Initially, engineers suspected issues with the application code that interacted with the database. Further investigation ruled out the application code as the cause.
* There was a suspicion of network-related problems causing the database connection failure. Subsequent investigation eliminated network issues as the root cause.

# Which Team/Individuals Was the Incident Escalated To:
* The incident was escalated to the on-call team, comprising engineers from the web application and database administration teams.

# How the Incident Was Resolved: 
* A temporary workaround was implemented by adjusting the database connection settings.
* The permanent fix involved correcting the misconfiguration in the database connection settings. The fix was thoroughly tested and validated before deployment.

# Root Cause and Resolution:
* The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the database connection settings, leading to connection failures.
* The issue was resolved by deploying a fix that corrected the misconfiguration. Rigorous testing ensured the stability of the fix before it went into production.

# Corrective and Preventative Measures:
* Patch the database connection settings to prevent similar misconfigurations.
* Implement enhanced monitoring for database connections to detect issues proactively.
* Establish a mandatory code review process, requiring at least two reviewers for changes related to database configurations.

# Conclusion:
* We deeply regret the inconvenience caused to our users during the 45-minute outage. Ensuring the reliability of our web application is paramount. We are committed to implementing measures to prevent a recurrence. This includes immediate corrections to the database configuration, implementing enhanced monitoring, and reinforcing our code review processes. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we work to improve our systems.
