# Firewall
* A firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies.
* Firewalls are a fundamental part of network security and are designed to protect your network from various threats, including unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and malicious attacks.
* Firewalls act as a barrier between an internal network and external networks, such as the internet. They are the first line of defense against threats.

# Types of Firewalls:
* Packet Filtering Firewalls: These filter traffic based on predefined rules, such as source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocols. They decide to allow or block packets based on these rules.
* Stateful Firewalls: Stateful firewalls keep track of the state of active connections and use this information to make decisions about allowing or blocking traffic. This makes them more secure than basic packet filtering firewalls.
* Proxy Firewalls: Proxy firewalls act as intermediaries between internal and external networks. They inspect, modify, and forward network traffic on behalf of clients. This adds an extra layer of security and privacy.
* Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW): NGFWs combine traditional firewall capabilities with advanced features, including intrusion prevention, antivirus, content filtering, and application-level filtering. They provide comprehensive security.
* Web Application Firewalls (WAFs): WAFs specifically focus on protecting web applications from common attacks, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
* Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS): While not firewalls in the traditional sense, IDPSs are often used in conjunction with firewalls to identify and respond to security threats. They monitor and analyze network traffic for malicious activity.
